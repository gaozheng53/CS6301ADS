    Suppose you are given a doubly-linked list class with elements stored
    (similar ro SLL) using an entry class as follows:

    ```java
    static class Entry<T> {
        T element;
        Entry<T> prev, next;
    }
    ```

    You realize that this is isomorphic to the entry class for binary trees:

    ```java
    static class Entry<T> {
        T element;
        Entry<T> left, right;
    }
    ```


    Write a recursive function to convert a doubly-linked list, in sorted
    order, into a height-balanced binary search tree, if we interpreted prev as
    left, and next as right.  Assume that lists are implemented with dummy
    headers. These are member functions of the list class, and do the work by
    rearranging references (pointers), without allocating additional space for
    elements. Write another function for the inverse problem: BST to sorted
    list. Signatures:

    ```java
    // Precondition: list is sorted
    void sortedListToBST() { ... }

    // Precondition: data is arranged as a binary search tree
    //	using prev for left, and next for right
    void BSTtoSortedList() { ... }
    ```

    Write functions to compute the nth Fibonacci number and compare their
    running times.  Since the numbers grow fast, use BigInteger class to
    represent the numbers.

    ```java
    // Do a simple linear scan algorithm: Fib[n] = Fin[n-1] + Fin[n-2];
    // Since numbers are stored with BigInteger class, use add for "+"
    static BigInteger linearFibonacci(int n) { ... }

    // Implement O(log n) algorithm described in class (Sep 15)
    static BigInteger logFibonacci(int n) { ... }
    ```

    Comapre 4 different versions of mergesort discussed in class (Sep 15) and
    evaluate the improvement in running times on int[] arrays.

    1.  Merge sort as described in text books, where temp array is allocated in
        each instance of merge.
    2.  Keep one temp array that is passed as a parameter to merge.
    3.  Improvement in (2) + use insertion sort for base case when the size of
        array is below some threshold.
    4.  Improvements in (2) and (3) + avoid copying to tmp array.

    Binary search: in class we saw a version of binary search that returned a
    boolean to indicate whether x occurs in the array or not. Rewrite the
    function to return the index of the largest element that is less than or
    equal to x.

    ```java
    // Preconditions: arr[0..n-1] is sorted, and arr[0] <= x < arr[n-1].
    // Returns index i such that arr[i] <= x < arr[i+1].
    public static<T extends Comparable<? super T>> int binarySearch(T[] arr, T x)
    ```

    Reorder an int array A[] by moving negative elements to the front, followed
    by its positive elements.  The relative order of positive numbers must be
    the same as in the given array.  Similarly, the relative order of its
    negative numbers should also be retained.  Write an algorithm that runs in
    O(nlogn), and uses only O(1) extra space (for variables), but can use O(log
    n) space for recursion.

    ```java
    void rearrangeMinusPlus(int[] arr) { ... }
    ```


6.  [20 points]

    Given an array of n distinct integers, in sorted order, starting at 1 and
    ending with n+k, find the k missing numbers in the sequence. Your algorithm
    should run in O(k+log(n)) time.  Note that a simple linear scan of the
    array can find the answer, but it will not meet the requirement on the
    running time.

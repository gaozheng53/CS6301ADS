DFS and its applications will be discussed in class on Fri, Sep 8.


1. [30 points]

   Topological ordering of a DAG.
   Implement two algorithms for ordering the nodes of a DAG topologically.  
   Both algoritms should return null if the given graph is not a DAG.

   ```java
   /** Algorithm 1. Remove vertices with no incoming edges, one at a
    *  time, along with their incident edges, and add them to a list.
    */
   List<Graph.Vertex> toplogicalOrder1(Graph g) { ... }

   /** Algorithm 2. Run DFS on g and add nodes to the front of the output list,
    *  in the order in which they finish.  Try to write code without using global variables.
    */
   List<Graph.Vertex> toplogicalOrder2(Graph g) { ... }
   ```


2. [30 points]

   Strongly connected components of a directed graph.  Implement the
   algorithm for finding strongly connected components of a directed
   graph (see page 617 of Cormen et al, Introduction to algorithms,
   3rd ed.).  Run DFS on G and create a list of nodes in decreasing
   finish time order.  Find G^T, the graph obtained by reversing all
   edges of G.  Note that the Graph class has a field revAdj that is
   useful for this purpose.  Run DFS on G^T, but using the order of
   the list output by the first DFS.  Each DSF tree in the second DFS
   is a strongly connected component.

   ```java
   int stronglyConnectedComponents(Graph g) { ... }
   ```
   Each node is marked with a component number, and the function returns
   the number of strongly connected components of G.


3. [30 points]

   Is a given directed graph Eulerian?

   A directed graph G is called Eulerian if it is strongly connected
   and the in-degree of every vertex is equal to its out-degree.  It
   is known that such graphs have a tour (cycle that may not be
   simple) that goes through every edge of the graph exactly once.
   Write a function that tests whether a given graph is Eulerian.
   Your algorithm need not find an Euler tour of the graph.

   ```java
   boolean testEulerian(Graph g) { ... }
   ```


4. [20 points]

   Is a given directed graph a DAG (directed, acyclic graph)?
   Solve the problem by running DFS on the given graph, and checking
   if there are any back edges.

   ```java
   boolean isDAG(Graph g) { ... }
   ```


5. [50 points]

   For a connected, undirected graph G=(V,E), an edge e in E is
   called a bridge if the removal of e from G breaks the graph into 2
   components.  A vertex u in V is called a cut vertex if the removal
   of u, along with its incident edges from G breaks it into 2 or more
   components.  The problem of finding bridges and cut vertices of a
   given graph will be discussed in class (see also Problem 22-2 in
   Cormen et al's Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd ed).

   ```java
   /** Find bridges and cut vertices of an undirected graph g.  Assume that g is connected.
    *  The list of bridges of g is returned by the function.  Cut vertices are marked
    *  by setting to true a boolean field "cut" defined for each vertex.
    */
   List<Graph.Edge> findBridgeCut(Graph g) { ... }
   ```
